# The likelihood of rain on my Wedding day (Perth's Rainfall in June) - A project Just for Laughs and Data

The aim of this project is to:
1. Try Marimo (A reactive notebook that uses pure python files)
2. Explore new libraries such as polars (dataframe library) and plotly express (visualisation library)
3. (Attempt) using ML algorithms
4. and, most importantly: determine if I should bring an umbrella for my wedding day!

This basic project entails the collection of data, data wrangling (cleaning, scrubbing and merging datasets), data exploration (and visualisation) and finally, the use of ML algorithms such as linear regression, random forest and support vector regressor.

The data was extracted from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, from Perth's airport station. However, most of the relevant data (dew point, humidity, wind, etc..) was behind a paywall which *spoilers* heavily affected the performance of the ML algorithms.

If you have any recommendations or tips to improve my coding or anything else - please let me know.

Cheers,

Manny
